Simple tool for transforming 5G UML models to UPPAAL models.

# Installation 

## Prerequisites
You need Python (it has been tested with 3.7.6) as well as pip (python package installation tool). Moreover, it is also required to have UPPAAL [1] available on your computer.

## Installation instructions
Retrieve the source code by downloading (and extracting) ZIP-archive or using git:

```console
git clone https://github.com/ptrbman/GGGGG.git
```

Afterwards, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. Change directory to the root folder of GGGGG and run the following commands (on Linux/MacOS):

```console
python -m venv pyenv
source pyenb/bin/activate
```

Now install the required packages using pip:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now the software is ready to use!

# Running

Start the program by running the following in the root directory of the application:
```console
python -m ggggg
```

## First time
In the settings tab you must select the location of the `verifyta` and `uppaal` binaries of the UPPAAL tool.

## Loading Instance
