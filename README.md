Simple tool for transforming 5G UML models to UPPAAL models.

# Installation 

## Prerequisites
You need Python (it has been tested with 3.7.6) as well as pip (python package installation tool). Moreover, it is also required to have UPPAAL [1] available on your computer.

## Installation instructions
Retrieve the source code by downloading (and extracting) ZIP-archive or using git:

```console
git clone https://github.com/ptrbman/GGGGG.git
```

Afterwards, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. Change directory to the root folder of GGGGG and run the following commands (on Linux/MacOS):

```console
python -m venv pyenv
source pyenv/bin/activate
```

Now install the required packages using pip:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now the software is ready to use!

# Running

Start the program by running the following in the root directory of the application:
```console
python -m ggggg
```

## First time
In the settings tab you must select the location of the `verifyta` and `uppaal` binaries of the UPPAAL tool.

## Loading Instance
The application supports loading instances defined as a soil-script generated by the USE-tool [2]. 

## Details Tab
In the details tab, details of the system are presented. It is also possible to search for an allocation which meets all deadlines. Note that UPPAAL is run in the background and the program does not resume until the search is finished. If the search takes a long time the program will freeze. The search is also highly sensitive to the values of `Executors` and `Message Queue Length` which are set in the settings tab.

## Verification Tab
In the verification tab it is possible to generate a UPPAAL model and check certain queries. The UPPAAL model generated will use the parameters `Executors` and `Message Queue Length`. Note that when a button is pressed, UPPAAL is run in the background and the program does not resume until query is finished. If the query takes a long time the program will freeze.

## Settings Tab
Here it is possible to set the location of the UPPAAL binaries as well as the parameters `Executors` and `Message Queue Length`.
